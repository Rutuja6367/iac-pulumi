## Intro

Briefly introduce the concept of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and explain the purpose of this README.

Explain the initial setup steps:

1. **Initialize**: Begin by initializing a new Pulumi project using the command pulumi new. This sets up the basic project structure and configuration.

2. **Infrastructure**: Define your infrastructure components within the project. Ensure that you understand what components you need for your IaaS setup.
3. **Required Packages**:  If your project requires additional packages or dependencies, install them as per your chosen programming language's package manager.

4. **Infrastructure Code**: To match your specific requirements, you should modify the provided infrastructure code. Refer to the relevant documentation and examples for guidance on making these customizations.

## IaaS Stack


1. **Initialize a Stack**:  Initialize a new stack with pulumi stack init. Stacks are useful for managing different environments, such as development, staging, or production.

2. **Configuration Variables**: Configure variables specific to your infrastructure, like region, instance types, and storage settings, using the pulumi config command. These settings will vary depending on your project.

## Introduction

Briefly introduce the concept of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and explain the purpose of this README.

## Prerequisites

List the prerequisites that users need to have in place before they can start using Pulumi for IaaS.

- Pulumi Installation
- Cloud Provider Account
- Programming Language

## Getting Started

Explain the initial setup steps:

1. **Initialize a New Pulumi Project**: Provide the command for initializing a new Pulumi project.

2. **Define Your Infrastructure**: Explain where to define your infrastructure components and provide a brief overview of what to include.

3. **Install Required Packages**: If necessary, mention how to install required packages for your chosen programming language.

4. **Customize Your Infrastructure Code**: Encourage users to modify the code to match their specific requirements and point them to relevant documentation and examples.

## Creating Your IaaS Stack

Explain how to create a Pulumi stack:

1. **Initialize a Stack**: Provide the command to initialize a new stack, and explain the purpose of stacks (e.g., for different environments).

2. **Set Configuration Variables**: Describe how to set configuration variables specific to your infrastructure. This can include variables like region, instance type, and storage configuration.

## Creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Here, we'll provide instructions on creating the VPC and associated resources.

1. **Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Define the steps to create the VPC. Include specifying the VPC CIDR block, region, and other relevant configuration options.

2. **Create Subnets**: Explain how to create subnets, including 3 public subnets and 3 private subnets, each in a different availability zone in the same region in the same VPC.

3. **Create an Internet Gateway**: Detail the process of creating an Internet Gateway and attaching it to the VPC.

4. **Create Public and Private Route Tables**: Guide users through creating public and private route tables.

5. **Associate Subnets with Route Tables**: Explain how to attach public and private subnets to their respective route tables.

6. **Create Public Route**: Describe how to add a public route in the public route table with the destination CIDR block `0.0.0.0/0` and the Internet Gateway as the target.

## Deploying Your IaaS

Provide instructions on how to deploy the IaaS resources:

- Run the `pulumi up` command.
- Mention that Pulumi will prompt for confirmation and explain the process briefly.

## Updating Your IaaS

Explain how to update the IaaS when changes are made:

- Run the `pulumi up` command.
- Mention that Pulumi will detect changes and apply them.

## Destroying Your IaaS

Explain how to destroy IaaS resources when they are no longer needed:

- Run the `pulumi destroy` command.
- Include a caution about the irreversible nature of this action.
